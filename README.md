# cub3D

## Description

**cub3D** is a graphical programming project inspired by the early 3D game *Wolfenstein 3D*.  
The goal of this project is to create a simple 3D game engine using the **raycasting** technique, allowing a first-person view inside a 2D map.

The project focuses on understanding how a 3D perspective can be rendered from a grid-based map, while handling player movement, wall collisions, textures, and real-time rendering.  
It also emphasizes low-level graphics programming, event handling, file parsing, and memory management in C.

The program uses the **MiniLibX** graphical library provided by 42.
